# Roulette-Game
A simple Roulette game in C language.<br>
Roulette is played with a wheel containing 38 different squares along its circumference. Two of these squares, numbered 0 and 00, are green; 18 squares are red, and 18 are black. The red and black squares alternate in color, and are numbered 1 through 36 in a random order.<br>
A small marble is spun within the wheel, which eventually comes to rest within a groove beneath one of the squares.<br> 
The game is played by betting on the outcome of each spin, in any one of the following ways:<br>
(i) By selecting a single red or black square, at 36-to-1 odds. Thus, if the opponent were to bet Rs.100 and the player wins,the player would receive a total of Rs.3600: the opponent's Rs.100, plus an additional Rs.3500. The opponent would lose his bet amount. If both have lost, their respective bet amount will be deducted.<br>
(ii) By selecting a color, either red or black, at 1-to-1 odds (excluding 0 and 00). Thus if a player chose red on a Rs.100 of opponent's bet, he or she would receive that Rs.100 if the marble came to rest beneath any red square. The opponent would lose his bet amount.<br>
(iii) By selecting either the odd or the even numbers (excluding 0 and 00), at 1-to-1 odds.<br>
(iv) By selecting either the low 18 or the high 18 numbers at 1-to-1 odds (excluding 0 and 00).<br>
